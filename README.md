Explainable Diabetes prediction using machine learning on PIMA Dataset using SHAP

I have investigated, analyzed, and applied machine learning techniques to the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. I have also compared the results using Explainable AI (XAI), which allows me to understand how ML models identify patients as either diabetes or non-diabetic based on which feature is more influential in accurately predicting the proper classification. Using the SHAP library, I examined and talked about the outcomes for XAI.

768 women from a community close to Phoenix, Arizona, USA, have their data included in the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, which was first sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Diabetes was the test result; 258 people tested positive and 500 tested negative. Thus, according to TYNECKI (2018), there is a single target (dependent) variable and eight attributes: age, pedigree diabetes function, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test), insulin, and pregnancy.
Since 1965, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has conducted biannual studies on the Pima community. Given that epidemiological data suggests that hereditary and environmental variables interact to cause type 2 diabetes (T2DM), the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset contains information about traits that may and should be related to
